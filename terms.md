## Cloud Scalability, and Reliability

### Test Driven Development - is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass. This is opposed to software development that allows code to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. 

### Continuous Integration - Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied. One of the key benefits of integrating regularly is that you can detect errors quickly and locate them more easily. As each change introduced is typically small, pinpointing the specific change that introduced a defect can be done quickly. In recent years CI has become a best practice for software development and is guided by a set of key principles. Among them are revision control, build automation and automated testing. 


### Continuous Delivery - Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.  You’re doing continuous delivery when: your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working on new features. Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to them. You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any environment on demand

###  Configuration Management -  Configuration management is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state. It’s a way to make sure that a system performs as it’s expected to as changes are made over time. Managing IT system configurations involves defining a system's desired state—like server configuration—then building and maintaining those systems. Closely related to configuration assessments and drift analyses, configuration management uses both to identify systems to update, reconfigure, or patch.

### Containerization - Containerization is defined as a form of operating system virtualization, through which applications are run in isolated user spaces called containers, all using the same shared operating system (OS). A container is essentially a fully packaged and portable computing environment:  Everything an application needs to run – its binaries, libraries, configuration files and dependencies – is encapsulated and isolated in its container. The container itself is abstracted away from the host OS, with only limited access to underlying resources – much like a lightweight virtual machine (VM). As a result, the containerized application can be run on various types of infrastructure—on bare metal, within VMs, and in the cloud—without needing to refactor it for each environment.


### Cloud Scalability, and Reliability - Cloud scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand. Scalability is one of the hallmarks of the cloud and the primary driver of its exploding popularity with businesses.
